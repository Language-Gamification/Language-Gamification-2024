### Call for papers

We invite submissions exploring the intersection of language and interactive learning through the lens of Language Gamification. We welcome papers that address the following themes:

* Any work combining deep (RL) learning methods for language with an interactive loop
* Definition and/or implementation of language games or language interactive loop
* Original interactive evaluation of LLM abilities, e.g., ChatArena and EconArena
*  Game theory or multi-agent techniques are applied to language, such as self-play, turn-taking, etc.
* Self-improvement and bootstrapping methods for LLMs
* Population-based, swarm, or iteration-based training methods for language
* In-context learning methods for LLM
* Live-improvement with self-reflecting methods, e.g., inner-monologue, constitutional AI.
* Agent LLMs that require interactive decision-making, planning, reasoning, tool use, etc.
* Training with LLM as a judge (or RLAIF) approaches that go beyond preference tuning
* Language emergence modeling papers
* Original work bridging interactive language acquisition and LLMs beyond ML

We appreciate any submissions believe contribute significantly to the field of Language Gamification, even if they don't perfectly fit within the listed categories.

We welcome submissions from researchers who go beyond the classic Machine Learning community. This includes work in linguistics, anthropology, cognitive science, psychology, economics, philosophy, etc., related to language gamification or language games.

### Formatting Instructions

All submissions must be in PDF format and in a single PDF file include, in this order:
1. The submitted paper
2. Technical appendices

The main text of a submitted paper is limited to <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;"> FOUR content pages </span>, including all figures and tables. Additional pages containing references don’t count as content pages.

The main text and references may be followed by technical appendices with no page limit.

All submissions must follow the NeurIPS-2024 styles. The corresponding style files can be downloaded as [Zip](/assets/files/Styles.zip) or accessed via [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/neurips-2024/tpsbbrdqcmsh).

For all other requirements, we follow the NeurIPS-2024 guidelines.
For more information, refer to the [NeurIPS-2024 Call for Papers](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2024/CallForPapers).

<br>

### Paper presentation

Accepted papers will be presented during joint poster sessions, and exceptional submissions will be selected for spotlight oral presentations. They will be made publicly available as non-archival reports, allowing for proceeding submission.

<!-- ### Topics of Interest -->
<!---->
<!-- __Centering on "instructions,"__ we invite submissions covering various topics, including but not limited to the list below: -->
<!---->
<!-- * __Modeling:__ algorithms and pipelines for learning from instructions and human feedback; designing training objectives and rewards; training and inference efficiency -->
<!-- * __Data Collection:__ crowd-sourcing; synthetic data generation; data democratization -->
<!-- * __Evaluation and Oversight__: effective and reliable oversight over existing models; enforcing guardrails and guarantees for model behaviors; interpretability and analysis -->
<!-- * __Engineering and Open-sourcing:__ best practice in training, evaluation and deployment; open-sourcing efforts; openness and reproducibility -->
<!-- * __Applications:__ long-context, multi-round and personalized instruction-following models -->
<!-- * __Multimodal and Multidisciplinary:__ instruction following models for computer vision, robotics, games, art, etc. -->
<!-- * __Limitations, Risks and Safety:__ bias and fairness; factuality and hallucination; safety concerns arising from instruction-following models -->
<!-- * Other adjacent research topics (e.g., in-context learning, prompting, multi-task learning) that enable better responses to instructions in dynamic environments -->

<!-- <br> -->
<!---->
<!-- ### Guidelines -->
<!---->
<!-- * Paper submission is hosted on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2023/Workshop/Instruction). -->
<!-- * We welcome papers __up to 9 pages (max)__, not including references or appendix.  -->
<!--   * Please use the provided LaTex template ([zip](/assets/template/instruction_workshop_template.zip), [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/instruction-workshop-at-neurips-2023-template/fqkhtqxvjrrq)) for your submission. -->
<!--   * The paper should be anonymized and uploaded to OpenReview as a single PDF.  -->
<!--   * You may use as many pages of references and appendix as you wish, but reviewers are not required to read the appendix.  -->
<!--   * We welcome 4-page extended abstract submissions. -->
<!-- * This is a __non-archival__ workshop. No submission will be indexed nor have archival proceedings. -->
<!--   * Accepted papers will appear on the workshop website.  -->
<!--   * They will also be available on OpenReview and NeurIPS virtual site. -->
<!--   * We accept submissions that are under review at other venues (e.g., ICLR 2024), as long as this does not violate the dual-submission / anonymity policy of the other venue. -->
<!-- * The review process will be double-blind. -->
<!-- * We will announce the best paper award at the workshop! -->
